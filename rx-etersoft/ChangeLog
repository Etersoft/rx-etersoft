	  so node.conf.sample is installed correctly.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed broken round-robin load balance algorithm.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed --terminate|--suspend|--force-terminate for
	  load balancing case.

	* Fixed --terminate|--suspend|--force-terminate for
	  usermode case.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed non-encrypted session mode. You might need to
	  set EXTERNAL_PROXY_IP in node.conf.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)

18.08.2008 FreeNX 0.7.3 "Priscilla One Year Edition"
	* Opened the 0.7.3 development.
	* Added logging of failed authentication attempts
	  to auth.log via syslog (3). This can be disabled by 
	  setting ENABLE_LOG_FAILED_LOGINS="0".
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added -nolisten tcp to nxagent invocation.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de, idea by  pappy- (Gentoo))
	* Used bash for all tasks as 'sh' might be not what we want
	  on standard ubuntu.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de, thx to tan (IRC))
	* Finally fixed mv not working for failed or terminated
	  sessions.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de, Terje Andersen <terander@guard.zapto.org>)
	* Added patch from 2005 to enable reconnect to 24-bit display via
	  32-bit or vice versa. Oops :)
	  (Sunil <funtoos at yahoo.com> )
	* Added 3.2.0 as a backend version for nxloadconfig.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added configuration key ENABLE_SOURCE_BASH_PROFILE for toggling of 
	  sourcing ~/.bash_profile.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added /usr/bin/xauth as default key and used /usr/X11R6/bin/xauth as
	  fallback.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed Makefile to stop on all errors.
	  (Idea by Hai Zaar <haizaar@gmail.com>, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Changed the default for ENABLE_PASSDB_AUTHENTICATION. If you had
	  added a user with different password via --adduser consider
	  re-activating this option in node.conf.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added constraints for passdb based commands. They are only available
	  when ENABLE_PASSDB_AUTHENTICATION="1" else a friendly error message
	  is shown. This should help with users using old tutorials.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added unix-console patch. Added default handler as unix-default with
	  a fallback to xterm,
	  (Idea by Jens Hatlak <jh@junetz.de>, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed external rdesktop keyboards: A "$" was missing.
	  (Bug by Phil Stricker <stril@gmx.de>, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added workaround for "ch" keyboard layout to nxdesktop_helper, 
	  which NXClient 3.2.0 means as de-ch.
	  (Bug by Phil Stricker <stril@gmx.de>, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added clean target to Makefile.
	  (Based on patch by Ubuntu FreeNX-Team, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Use :0.0 if mirrorhost is 127.0.0.1 and add -localhost for 
	  enhanced security. Also increase sleep timeout for slow machines.
	  (Based on Patch by Jeremy Wilkins <wjeremy@shaw.ca>, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Allow RDP "Run application" sessions to work correctly.
	  (David Corral < davefury@gmail.com > & the Silice Telecom staff,
	   fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Merge Xresources on startup of session.
	  (Jeremy Wilkins <wjeremy@shaw.ca>)
	* Added nx-session-launcher from Ubuntu FreeNX-Team to use FreeNX with
	  ConsoleKit.
	  (marceloshima@gmail.com, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Moved logging functions to a more appropriate place.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Finally fixed the bug when NX Client was stopped on "Negotiating
	  link parameters" and failed session after first session suspend.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed missing "fi" statement. In fact it was a missing ";;".
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Used source instead of "." for Makefile. (Closes: #13954)
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Allow passwords with '\' by changing read -s to read -r -s.
	  (Closes: #10699)
	  (Patch by rpfuller@bat.berlios.de, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Allow passwords with special chars by using new url_decode on
	  agent_password. (Closes: #10248)
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed start/stop exit codes.
	  (Patch by Gentoo Portage, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Finally checked for all service ports. (cups, media, samba)
	  and also checked it on the host where the load balancing actually
	  leads to.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed broken fallback logic if SSH_CLIENT variables cannot be read
	  correctly.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Overhauled the usermode: 
		* There are now two modes of operation.
	  	- One statically setting the 
		  ENABLE_USERMODE_AUTHENTICATION key
	  	  in node.conf. (old behavior)
		- Or using nxserver-usermode as startup 
		  binary, which directly goes into the 103 stage.
		* Fixed using commandline parameters like --cleanup 
		  for static usermode.
		* Enabled the root commandline parameters in usermode.
		* Fixed usage of "nx" user as normal user in usermode.
		* Disabled slave mode and load balancing for usermode.
		* Fixed creation of the logfile directory.
		* Fixed nxnode usage of SSH_CLIENT using fallback mechanism.
	  (Patch by nbartos@bat.berlios.de, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added disabled nxserver-suid wrapper with help from Google. To 
	  enable it uncomment the suid_install target in Makefile.
	  ( Alistair Riddoch <alriddoch@google.com>, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Automatically disabled slave mode, when load balancing is activated.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Made ENABLE_SLAVE_MODE="1" the new default as its faster
	  and more reliable. If you encounter any problems with it,
	  disable it in node.conf.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Changed type for external agents to windows-helper or vnc-helper
	  so that those sessions can be mirrored / shadowed as well.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added nxshadowacl.sample component to be able to shadow
	  foreign sessions.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Prepared shadowing foreign users for VNC-shadowing.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added shadow support to --listsession command.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added shadow mode as nxagent target.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed shadow mode and made it usable.
	  (Patch by Amin Shehata <amino7 at yahoo dot com>, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)

14.03.2008 FreeNX 0.7.2 "Priscilla Edition"
	* Opened the 0.7.2 development.
	* Fixed the display of local sessions to display only 
	  when session type is VNC.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed the issue that commercial NXClient was called with 0 parameters
	  and such the "Connection Wizard" came up.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added freenx-server startup script. You can make a symlink to
	  /etc/init.d/ to have it start automatically.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added catching of exception after failed nscd command.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Invoke curl with --proxy "" for automatic download of ppd files.
	  (Wolfgang Schweer <schweer@cityweb.de>)
	* Reorganized nxsetup to have a function for parsing command line
	  options.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added nxsetup --test to test the configuration and connection to
	  localhost nxserver.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added -o ConnectTimeout 3 to nxnode-login for test-nx case.
	  (cedric briner <work@infomaniak.ch>)
	* Added more examples for "failed ssh connection to localhost" cases.
	  (cedric briner <work@infomaniak.ch>, fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed helpers (desktop, viewer) to honour the AGENT_EXTRA_OPTIONS_{RDP,RFB}
	  parameters set in node.conf.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed the default value for ENABLE_CLIPBOARD="both" instead of ' = '.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed parsing of SMB port and added a fallback if mport file is empty.
	  (Patch from Gentoo Portage)
	* Run nscd only when nscd.pid is present.
	  (Patch from Gentoo Portage)
	* Fixed possible bug in nxserver when $USER is not set.
	  (Patch from Gentoo Portage)
	* Set ENABLE_USESSION="1" option by default - its hard to find and those who know can
	  shut it off anyway. Added automatic adding of user nx to group utmp.
	  (Patch by Gentoo Portage)
	* Added support for 3.1.0 and later backends. Made 2.0.0 backend the
	  default and added a fallback to 1.5.0 via the same detection mechanism.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added the configuration key ENABLE_PULLDOWN_MENU to be able to
	  disable the pulldown menu for rootless sessions.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed a small bug in nxserver when password has spaces at the end or
	  beginning.
	  (Dimitar Paskov)
	* Fixed round-robin mode of load balancing.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added check for /tmp/.X11-unix/X*.
	  (Yves-Gaël Chény <yves-gael.cheny at tranquil-it-systems.fr>)
	* Fixed --send|--broadcast for load balancing case.
	  Note: ssh is used, so you need to either insert your root ssh password 
	  for the nodes again and again, use a public key + agent or use host keys.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added possibility to use the new nxsmb backend. This enables us to support
	  CIFS and SMB printing at the same time - without recompiling samba -
	  via the nxredir preload library.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added usage of nxredir library to forward port 139,445 to the
	  client side forwarded SMB port.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Made the slave mode finally functional. With that slave mode it is
	  possible to do a single sign on instead of the multiple logins used
	  before. It is also possible to use a suid wrapper to login as user.
	  With single sign on session startup is a lot faster. This is true 
	  especially if there are many printers and files to be shared.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added detection of backend version and added this output 
	  to version string.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added foomatic-ppdfile to the retested values.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added possibility to balance all nx services to different cores
	  using taskset. Use for example USE_PROCESSOR_TASKSET="3,4" to 
	  balance all services to processor cores 3 and 4.
	  This wish was granted for Gregory Carter.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added initial code to add an application to an already running
	  rootless session.
	  Set ENABLE_ADVANCED_SESSION_CONTROL="1" and use session name
	  like "add <sessionname>". Unfortunately the client returns an
	  error, but the application is started anyway.
	  The wish was granted for Bernhard Donaubauer.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added option to disable the showing of running sessions.
	  Set ENABLE_SHOW_RUNNING_SESSIONS="0" if you want that behaviour.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Updated documentation in INSTALL file.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added nxviewer-passwd to distribution. It is a fork of the
	  tightvnc vncpasswd part, which is necessary for FreeNX to work
	  with standard vncviewer.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added a Makefile so FreeNX can be build and installed via.
	  $ make
	  $ # edit nxloadconfig to point where it should install to
	  $ make install
	  Hereby FreeNX is installed to where nxloadconfig points and
	  static paths in nxredir and nxsmb are adjusted accordingly.
	  So if you want it to be in /usr/NX/ be sure to apply
	  gentoo-nomachine.diff first or edit nxloadconfig manually.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added nxacl.sample component. If you copy nxacl.sample to
	  $PATH_BIN/nxacl you can make as complex acl scenarios as you
	  want. You have complete control over all data and can deny
	  any session.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)

14.10.2007 FreeNX 0.7.1 "Hip Hop Edition"
	* Fixed the issue that makes fonts look tiny and unreadable by default 
	  with freenx and the commercial client. (diamond@google.com)
	* Added invalidating of NSCD cache after group and user add.
	  (diamond@google.com)
	* Added better wording with less misunderstanding to dialog of 
	  nxclient for Suspend/Terminate/Close case. (diamond@google.com)
	* Added 'dialog_interface=dialog' option since many installations may 
	  not have Xdialog and since xmessage is very limiting. This new option 
	  will work on any machine that has dialog and xterm.
	  (puterguy@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed the APPLICATION_LIBRARY_PRELOAD to be just a warning and fixed 
	  the default path. (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added drivers.cache.all that is reloaded just every 60 minutes.
	  (puterguy@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed missing services stop that lead to redundant mounts and still
	  running cupsd processes.
	  (puterguy@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added support for mount.cifs additionally to the deprecated
	  smbmount. (fabianx@bat.berlios.de, puterguy@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added "host" output to --list to see which user is connected to
	  which server in case of loadbalancing.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de, Bastian Kames <kames@ibg-monforts.de>)
	* Fixed nxclient -printer to not use commercial client, because its too 
	  slow in case of huge databases like foomatic. (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Removed bad -noautokill option from the nxclient dialog spawning.
	  (wayneb@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added basic support for mirrored sessions.
	  * The functionality can be used by connecting to VNC session
	    and choosing to "resume" such a session.
	  * New configuration key: ENABLE_MIRROR_VIA_VNC=1
	  * New configuration key: ENABLE_DESKTOP_SHARING=1
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed some portability issues.
	  * Fixed nxloadconfig in case that COMMAND_X is not only one word,
	    like "openssl md5".
	  * Added usage of "openssl md5" instead of "md5sum" by default.
	  * Changed perl to COMMAND_PERL.
	  * Removed rev and replaced the code with efficient awk code.
	  * Added an outcommented way to also use "POSIX find" for history
	    cleaning.
	  (Peter O'Gorman <peter@pogma.com>)
	* Fix ownership of $SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS in nxkeygen, just in case
	  it is run without nxsetup.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de, thx to sambiase on #nx)
	* Fixed diverse occurences of $sess_id in nxnode, when hostname
	  contains whitespace.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Fixed setting up KDE_PRINTRC altogether if ENABLE_KDE_CUPS is not 1,
	  and handles errors better when it is but kde-config is not available
	  or fails.
	  (scop@bat.berlios.de)
	* Changed unix:$display -> :$display to enable FreeNX usage with newer
	  xlib in C (used for example by Novell).
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Enabled 3.0.0 backend with same usage pattern as 2.[0|1].0 backend.
	  (Shawn Starr <spstarr@kde.org>)
	* Bumped version number to 2.1.0-71 to let things like File-sharing
	  port and auxiliary channels work.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added parsing of aux parameter. This should remove all keyboard
	  related problems with nxdesktop with 2.[01].0 backend.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Renamed nxclient to nxdialog and setup the necessary environment
	  variable for nxagent to find it.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de, Thanks to NoMachine for giving this hint)
	* Added experimental support for usage of external rdesktop and
	  vncviewer programs.	  
	  This is for example needed for 3.0.0 backend.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Changed the default load balancing algorithm to "random"
	  as the nxcheckload script might not be available.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)
	* Added ENABLE_CLIPBOARD="none|client|server|both" option
	  to node.conf to disable, restrict or enable the clipboard
	  synchronization.
	  (fabianx@bat.berlios.de)

07.07.2007 FreeNX 0.7.0 "Jornade SPL Edition VI+1"
	* Fixed the printing support for CUPS 1.2.
	  Older versions of CUPS are no longer supported.
	  * Note: You must do as root:

	          cp /usr/lib/cups/backend/ipp /usr/lib/cups/backend/nxipp
		  chmod 755 /usr/lib/cups/backend/nxipp

		  Or alternatively re-run nxsetup.

	* Added automatic downloading of PPDs, if the client supports it.
	* Added configuration vars to tweak the new behaviour.
	* Added cups seamless support with no "use this driver?" dialogs at all.
	  * Note: You need nxcupsd-wrapper on the client side for CUPS 1.2
	          clients.

	          Get it from nxutils repository.

	* Fixed Support for "Running" sessions - again.
