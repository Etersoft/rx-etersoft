# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
# Edit /etc/rx-etersoft/node.conf.d/* files instead
#
# It is mostly compatible with NoMachine node.conf. The most important 
# difference is that no spaces are allowed when assigning values (eg 
# "A=value" is allowed, "A = value" is NOT).
#
# These files are sourced by bash, so you can do some fancy stuff here if you
# want to, but be aware that it is sourced 3 times per connection. If you 
# want autostart stuff, set NODE_AUTOSTART instead!
# 
#
# You surely are aware that FreeNX is based on the fantastic results that
# the hard work by NoMachine.com has achieved. NoMachine.com released the
# core NX libraries under the GPL. The installation of these libs are the
# precondition for all FreeNX scripts to work. If you are installing this
# software with the help of one of the package management tools of your
# Linux distribution, you can assume that this dependency is taken care of
# by the tool.
#
# You have questions about the inner workings of the NX technology?
#
# Then you are recommended to first check out the rich and very detailed
# NoMachine documentation and their online Knowledge Base at
